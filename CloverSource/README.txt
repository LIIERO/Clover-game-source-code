Make sure the game folder is extracted!

Do not delete anything from the data folder or look into it to avoid potential spoilers,
unless you want to cheat. 
Except for that, every file located in this folder can be a part of a puzzle.
(Hint1 - clover.exe is a part of every puzzle)
(Hint2 - eloquent)




Read further only if your game closed when leaving the page 26 or beyond.




If your game closed when entering the page 27 or beyond,
it means your antivirus software denied it permission to copy
a file you need to solve a puzzle, from "data\gfspawns" folder to this one.

I will add a workaround or change the entire mechanic in the future,
but for now I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. :c
