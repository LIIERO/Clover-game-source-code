# Clover-game-source-code
Source code of my puzzle game which is a solo project of mine.
Download the game here: https://llero.itch.io/clover

This code is pretty bad. When I started making this game I was still learning.
All of the code is contained in one python file main.py, you can run the game with just what you have in this repo.
